This code was written by me for the USC Advanced Game Project, EMPATH, a motion-controlled martial-arts / spellcasting game developed in Unreal Engine 4.

This code will NOT work as is, due to the project requiring plugins that I do not have the right to distribute, namely, the VR Expansion Plugin, and Wwise.

It is uploaded for the purpose of preserving the systems that I created for the project, and allowing other developers to see how we achieved the final effects that we did. The EmpathCharacter and EmpathAIController family of classes are based upon the AI framework created by Epic Games for Robo Recall, though they  have been heavily modified to work with the particulars of our game system. All other code was custom written for the project.

Cheers.
